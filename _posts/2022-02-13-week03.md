title: Week 3: Git & Jim Hall

# Git

I have to confess here that I am actually a beginner to Git. In class nobody raised their hand and admitted that they are beginner, so I was scared to raised my hand too, and I raised my hand to intermediate instead. But in fact I only knows how to clone, pull and push using the GitHub GUI. So I'm glad we actually got to learn the basics of Git in class.
