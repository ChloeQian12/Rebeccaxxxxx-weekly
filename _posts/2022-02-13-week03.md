# Git

I have to confess here that I am actually a beginner to Git. In class nobody raised their hand and admitted that they are beginner, so I was scared to raised my hand too, and I raised my hand to intermediate instead. But in fact I only knows how to clone, pull and push using the GitHub GUI. So I'm glad we actually got to learn the basics of Git in class. 

Things I learned that I didn't know: 

* Version Control Systems used to be centralized, but now it is decentralized, so all versions of the project	is saved on every contributor's computer. 

* There is merge and merge conflict. I literally had no idea they exist, because when I worked on past projects, I always wait for others to complete their parts and then pull and work on mine. I didn't know others and I can work synchronously on the same file, and under most cases GitHub is able to merge them. 

* The sequence for pushing goes like commit --> pull --> push. 

* We can add as many remotes as we want to our local repository.
